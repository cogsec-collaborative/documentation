# ADMIN_HOWTO run a deployment using slack channels

## Lifecycle of a new rumour

A new rumour has started online.  You’ve seen it yourself, someone has sent you an example of it, you’ve seen another group tracking it - there are a bunch of ways to spot something new happening.  Now what? 

Tell people:
* Put a message in #repository, telling people about this new rumour.  _Use the words [NEW RUMOR] so it’s easy to find later?_

## Decide whether to start a response:
* Do a quick check that it’s a rumour.  One sighting doesn’t make an incident.  15 copies of the same message on Twitter, or 3 friends sending you the same strange DM, and you’re probably onto something. 
* Then, find someone to be responsible for this.  It’s probably going to be you, but if you don’t have the time to set up a response, ping the #general slack channel and ask for a volunteer.  All instructions below here are for whoever takes on this responsibility.

## Start a slack channel for the rumor:
* Name it rumor-xxx where xxx is a short description of the rumor, like gaspumps-infected or stafford-act.   Make the first message in the channel a description of the rumor
* Put a message into #general and #repository, telling people there’s a new rumor channel and asking them to look for data on it
