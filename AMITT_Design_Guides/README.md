# AMITT Design Guides

## README: About the Design Guides

We've moved these AMITT design guides to [the main AMITT repository](https://github.com/cogsec-collaborative/AMITT/tree/main/AMITT_GUIDES).  

These are introductions to the AMITT family of disinformation models: STIX, TTPs, and Countermeasures.  It covers their origins, their contents, and their uses.
