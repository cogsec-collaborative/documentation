“The COVID19MisInfo Portal is a rapid response project of the Ryerson Social Media Lab at Ted Rogers School of Management. The project is funded by the Government of Canada via the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The aim of this project is two-fold: (1) put a spotlight on COVID-19 related misinformation and (2) to provide Canadians with timely and actionable information that we all can use to protect ourselves and our communities. Our team of computational social scientists, communications professionals and developers are hard at work curating trusted information about COVID-19 and developing additional real-time information visualization dashboards to keep track of false claims related to COVID-19 from around the web.”
